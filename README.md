LiveUSB Install package for Arch Linux
=======================================

These are the files necessary to create an [Arch
Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) package for [LiveUSB
Install](http://live.learnfree.eu/).

With LiveUSB Install you can effortlessly install various Linux distributions
on your thumbdrive.

If you only want to install it, you don't need to be here. Install
[yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt) (or another [AUR
helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers)) and then get the
[live-usb-install](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/live-usb-install/). This
repository is intended mostly for people interested in contributing to the AUR
package itself.

The package was created by by [Andr√© Laszlo](http://www.laszlo.nu)
